## What is this?

This project provides a Gradle plugin that provides common build opinions to repositories in the openrewrite GitHub organization.organization's source code.

## Code Genome Project artifacts

`org.openrewrite.build.recipe-repositories` (applied by the `recipe-library` and `language-library` plugins) adds
https://artifacts.codegenomeproject.org/maven as a dependency repository for the `org.openrewrite` and `io.moderne`
groups, and excludes those same groups from Maven Central, to avoid downloading older versions.

Set credentials as Gradle properties in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` — never in a file under source control:

```properties
codegenomeUsername=you@example.com
codegenomePassword=cgp_...
```

In CI, expose the same values as the `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_codegenomeUsername` and `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_codegenomePassword`
environment variables.

## Publishing

Recipe and language libraries publish only to the Code Genome Project. `org.openrewrite.build.publish-cgp` (applied by
the `recipe-library` and `language-library` plugins) adds the CGP bucket as a publishing repository, and stays inert
unless `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are set, so only CI publishes.

`org.openrewrite.build.root` no longer stages artifacts to Maven Central. Modules that still have to reach Central
during the transition can apply the deprecated `org.openrewrite.build.publish-maven-central` plugin, which restores the
Sonatype repository and its `closeAndReleaseSonatypeStagingRepository` task.
